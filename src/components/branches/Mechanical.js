        <h3>MECH01: Solar-Powered Agricultural Robot </h3>
The objective of this challenge is to encourage participants to design and fabricate an advanced solar-powered agricultural robot capable of addressing two significant real-world issues: sustainable farming practices and effective disaster response in agricultural regions. Through this competition, participants will be tasked with creating a versatile robot that can navigate challenging terrains, perform agricultural tasks efficiently and sustainably, and operate solely on solar energy. Additionally, participants are expected to integrate AI algorithms for obstacle detection and plant recognition, while also providing modular attachments for disaster response functions. The goal is to foster innovation, creativity, and problem-solving skills, leading to the development of a working model that showcases the potential of robotics in promoting sustainable agriculture and efficient disaster management.

        <h3>MECH04: Next-Generation Multi-Terrain Hovercraft. </h3>
Hovercrafts are innovative vehicles that utilize a cushion of air to glide over surfaces, combining elements of boats, airplanes, and land vehicles. By generating lift through an air cushion and propulsion from a rear-mounted fan, hovercrafts can traverse a wide range of terrains, including water, mud, ice, and grasslands. Their unique design allows them to move smoothly over both solid and liquid surfaces, making them invaluable for search and rescue missions, military operations, transportation in remote or difficult-to-reach areas, and even as recreational vehicles. Despite their versatility, designing advanced hovercrafts presents challenges in terms of efficiency, stability, and control, making them an exciting area of research and development. Develop an advanced hovercraft system capable of efficient and controlled movement over various terrains, including land and water. The system should integrate multiple propulsion mechanisms, such as air-driven lift fans and directional thrusters, while optimizing for stability, and energy efficiency. Additionally, design a user-friendly control interface that enables precise navigation and intuitive operation of the hovercraft across different environments.    </p>
