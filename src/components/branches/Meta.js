            META01 : The challenge of phosphorus reduction in steel produced
            directly from DRI through induction root.{" "}
          </h3>
          In the current era of research, focusing on green technologies as a
          consequence, the consumption of fossil fuels in the production of
          steel is disregarded. So, the use of DRI directly induction melting
          becomes found to be a new root in steel production, however, the scope
          of dephosphorization of molten steel in induction melting root is
          limited. To assure good quality and to compete for the international
          market it is necessary to achieve a phosphorus level of steel should
          be less than 0.03%. An Innovative process root to produce low
          phosphorus quality steel using an induction furnace and DRI is a
          challenging problem of the day. So, your task is to suggest suitable
          alternatives to Blast furnace root for large-scale High-quality steel
          production.

            META05 : Enhancing Consistency of Sinter Characteristics for
            Economical Pig Iron Production.{" "}
          </h3>
          A steel manufacturer produces pig iron through blast furnace roots.
          The major raw materials used are iron ore, limestone/dolomite, and
          coke. A company observes that due to the lack of supply of good
          quality ore and iron ore and associated hike in the prices of these
          raw materials resultant pig iron production is uneconomical. The
          company also found as an alternative they find that iron ore is found
          at low prices. therefore, they dic=scide the iron ore fine in the form
          of a sinter with the appreciation that the use of a sinter in a blast
          furnace increases the rate of production, reduces the coke rate, and
          thus reduces the production cost. The company started using ore fines
          by setting up a new sinter plant. Input to the sinter plant or iron
          ore fines, lime and dolomite fines, coke breeze, mill scale, quick
          lime, black furnace return, cold sinter return, hot sinter return, and
          flue dust. The company has performed several trials to get the
          required properties of sinter, but they have observed that the sinters
          produced in their sinter plant have irregular characteristics
          (measured by basicity ratio ((CaO%+MgO%)/(SiO_2%)), tumbling index
          (TI) and reduction degradation index (RDI) even after maintaining
          uniform operational parameter. The details of compositional and sinter
          property data obtained during these trials are available if required
          You as a Metallurgical Engineer suggests a suitable reason for fixing
          the irregularity of the sinter characteristics that can be used for
          the production of pig iron through the blast furnace route.
